#Getting and Cleaning Data
##Course Project - Code Book


This document provides information about the generated sets by the script run_analysis.R, provided in this repository.

###Approach

The script has 5 steps according to the Course requirement.
- Step 1 : loading the test and train data into data frames and join them together into one total data frame.
  + test and train data *--> 10299 obs. of 561 variables*
  + test and train subject data *--> 10299 obs. of 1 variables*
  + test and train label data *--> 10299 obs. of 561 variables*
- Step 2 : loading feature information and extracting mean and standard deviation information into new data frame
  + loading the feature information into a data frame *--> 561 obs. of 2 variables*
  + extracting from the total test and train data only that the variables with the mean or standard deviation (std) information *--> 10299 obs. of 66 variables*
- Step 3 : Formatting activity expressions from numeric into specific text expression
  + loading the activity information in to a data frame --> 6 obs. of 2 variables
  + formatting the Activities into readable text
  + replacing the values 1 to 6 within the label data frame with the readable activity text
  + The first variable subject denotes the subject number that performed an activity. In total there are 30 subjects.
  The second variable activity denotes the activity performed by the subject. There are six activities, listed here:
    1. WALKING becomes Walking
    + WALKING_UPSTAIRS becomes Walking upstairs
    + WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS becomes Walking downstairs
    + SITTING becomes Sitting
    + STANDING becomes Standing
    + LAYING becomes Laying
- Step 4 : Formatting the variable names with read able names
  + formatting the variable names
    + tBodyAcc-mean()-X becomes tBodyAcc_Mean_X
    + tBodyAcc-std()-Y becomes tBodyAcc_std_Y
    + fBodyAcc-mean()-Z becomes fBodyAcc_mean_Z
    + fBodyBodyGyroMag-mean() becomes fBodyGyroMag_mean
    + ...
    + A full description of the features is best obtained from the file features_info.txt
  + giving the MeanStdTotal data frame from step 2 the re-formated variable names
  + giving the label data frame a readable variable name
  + giving the subject data frame a readable variable name
- Step 5 : calculating the mean of all measures (3:68) of each subject and activity combination and writing back the data frame result into a file
  + required to get the average of each variable for each activity and each subject, and there are 6 activities in total and 30 subjects in total, we have 180 rows with all combinations for each of the 66 features
  + writing back the data frame result into a file called **Total.txt**




###Original data set

Taken from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones:

"The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain."
